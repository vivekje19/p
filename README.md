**GraphQL + Deno + Oak Framework + PostgresQL**

# Introduction GraphQL
GraphQL is a query language for APIs, not a database and a runtime for fulfilling application queries with existing data.
The real secret is that GraphQL ensures that the developer and application only loads the relevant and absolute necessary data, even if it's from multiple sources(tables).
GraphQL server returns predicted data in responses that are described in request by the client, so it is fast in loading.

GraphQL gives permission to the client that what do they want to fetch the exact data, but the client only fetches the data by a query that is described in the schema of the requested query on the server.

  **Describe your data**
  ```
   type User {
      userName: String
      email: String
      address: String
      pincode: Int
    }
 ``` 
 
 **Ask for what you want**
 ```     
      {
          User {
            userName
            email
          }
        }
 ```
  **Get predictable results**    
  ```
  
  
   {
      "User": {
        "UserName": "Krishna",
        "email": "krishna@gmail.com"
      },
      {
        "UserName": "Ram",
        "email": "ram@gmail.com"
      }
    }

  ```
  
  
  # Type System in GraphQL

GraphQL is a strongly typed language. Type System defines various data types that can be used in a GraphQL application. The type system helps to define the schema, which is a contract between client and server. The commonly used GraphQL data types are as follows −
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th style="text-align:center; width:12%;">Sr.No.</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Types &amp; Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">1</td>
<td><p><b>Scalar</b></p>
<p>Stores a single value</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">2</td>
<td><p><b>Object</b></p>
<p>Shows what kind of object can be fetched</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">3</td>
<td><p><b>Query</b></p>
<p>Entry point type to other specific types</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">4</td>
<td><p><b>Mutation</b></p>
<p>Entry point for data manipulation</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">5</td>
<td><p><b>Enum</b></p>
<p>Useful in a situation where you need the user to pick from a prescribed list of options</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>



 **Scalar Type**
 
 
  Scalar types are primitive data types that can store only a single value. The default scalar types that GraphQL offers are −

  -  **Int −** Signed 32-bit Integer

  - **Float −**  Signed double precision floating point value

  - **String −** UTF - 8-character sequence

  -  **Boolean −** True or false

  -  **ID −** A unique identifier, often used as a unique identifier to fetch an object or as the key for a cache.
 

  - **Object Type−**
    The object type is the most common type used in a schema and represents a group of fields. Each field inside an object type maps to another type, thereby allowing nested types. In other words, an object type is composed of multiple scalar types or object types.

    The syntax for defining an object type is-


    ```

       type object_type_name{
	   field1: data_type
	   field2:data_type 
	   ....
	   fieldn:data_type
	}
				

    ``` 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  # Schemas, resolvers, Query and Mutation GraphQL terms
  - **Schemas:**  GraphQL describes the functionality available to the client applications that connect to it. A GraphQL schema is made up of object types, which define which kind of object you can request and what fields it has.As queries come in, GraphQL validates the queries against the schema. GraphQL then executes the validated queries. 
```
User Schema
 type User {
    userName: String
    email: String
    address: String
    pincode: Int
  }
  ```
  - **Resovers:** 
 Resolver is a collection of functions that generate response for a GraphQL query. In simple terms, GraphQL server won’t know what to do with an incoming query unless you tell it using a resolver.A resolver tells GraphQL how and where to fetch, insert, update and delete  the data corresponding to a given field.
 
 

```
fieldName:(root, args, context, info) => { result }

```
<table>
<tbody><tr>
<th style="text-align:center; width:12%;">Sr.No.</th>
<th style="text-align:center;">Arguments &amp; Description</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">1</td>
<td><p><b>root</b></p>
<p>The object that contains the result returned from the resolver on the parent field.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">2</td>
<td><p><b>args</b></p>
<p>An object with the arguments passed into the field in the query.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">3</td>
<td><p><b>context</b></p>
<p>This is an object shared by all resolvers in a particular query.</p></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td class="ts">4</td>
<td><p><b>info</b></p>
<p>It contains information about the execution state of the query, including the field name, path to the field from the root.</p></td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>


 - **Query:** 
  Query is an entry point, from which client can fetch the data.

```
type Query {
    getUsers(id :ID, userName: String): [User]    
    
  }

``` 
Here Query is an entry point and getUsers is defined as a resolver function, id and userName is defined as argument which can be passed in function and filter the data. User is defined for user schema which will access and validate the fields user schema.


- **Mutation:** Mutation queries modify data in the data store and returns a value. It can be used to insert, update, or delete data. Mutations are defined as a part of the schema.

```
type Mutation{
  addUser(input: UserInput): [User]
}

``` 
Here Mutation is an entry point and addUser is defined as a resolver function which will insert the users data into database, UserInput is defined as schema which will access and validate the fields UserInput schema. User is also a defined schema and it is used here that after inserting  addUser resolver return inserted user data according to User scema.
